Library for Object Detection with Point Cloud Library (PCL)

This code is based on my [bachelor thesis](http://marcel-juenemann.de/pub/Bachelor-Juenemann.pdf) from 2012. All this does is detect tables (plane surfaces) and then all things on top of that are considered objects. I also have some code for object classification/recognition lying around somewhere, but didn't get around to putting it on github yet...

**Disclaimer:** I believe this was quite a nice project back in 2012, but I'm sure there must be something better in the PCL community now, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend using this.
